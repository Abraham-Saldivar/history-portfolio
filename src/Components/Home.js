          In Ira berlinâ€™s, Many Thousands Gone, he accounts that historically
          Africans and Europeans have been intertwined with each other during
          the 1600s. Creole societies emerged in trading centers the first of
          which to appear were in trading centers along the coasts of Africa.
          These creoles developed intercultural skills and used these skills to
          mediate trade between Europeans and Africans. When Europe started
          colonizing the Americas, creole slaves followed the expansion, so
          creole societies emerged on the rim of the atlantic. During this era,
          skin color had little effect on their lives. Instead the skills they
          had as intermediaries proved their merit. Although creoles that
          identified more towards either European or African culture were
          shunned by the opposite, structurally there was nothing prohibiting
          them from improving their status. Even some creole slaves were able to
          purchase their freedom and continue their lives as merchants. It was
          apparent that there were just societies with slaves, not slave
          societies which the colonies came to be in the 1700s.
